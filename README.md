**What is Project Euler?**

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of computational math problems intended to be solved with programming.

**Structure**
- Solutions to each problem can be found in the `haskell/` directory
- `Euler.hs` contains commonly used functions and lists (e.g., the Fibonacci sequence, factorials, etc.)
